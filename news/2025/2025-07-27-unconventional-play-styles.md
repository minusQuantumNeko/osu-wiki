<br>Greetings, reader! Judging by the fact you are reading this right now - you are interested in learning more about different ways to play osu!, right? Great, because that's exactly what we will be doing today. So get ready and let's dive right into the play styles you might not have even considered before!

## [Medal Hunting](#navigation)

osu! medal hunting is a style of playing that involves playing osu! to obtain very cool looking shiny heptagons that say you did something special. *Oh I would hope you don't think it's that simple.*

Unlike most other materialistic ways of showing skill in this game, such as ranking or pp, medals are official goals that devs have put into the game since nearly the beginning that encourage you to play osu! in ways you may fear or never have thought of, and getting a medal means you've earned it and it's yours to keep, a very thrilling experience! Besides participating in some World Cup for #1, these medals feel like the closest one can get to beating the game officially. And there's no sense of decay or uncertainty, because you either got the medal or didn't. That's how it is for every medal. Medals are a bunch of tests, jokes, and cultural references, some of which can be ridiculously silly or peak lunacy, testing players in very unique ways that once you showcase you're able to do by performing what is demanded, you get to keep a medal that says you were able to pull it off. You can boast about it if you wish, make players scroll past that wall of medals you have in your profile, because you played the game in very specific ways that not everybody can.

On top of this, medals have a Hush-Hush and Hush-Hush (Expert) category that not only challenge players in very specific ways as a medal does normally, but as the name implies, challenge osu! medal hunters to go hunt for how exactly they are supposed to get a particular medal, typically only with a medal icon, hint (flair text), and subhint. If that sounds difficult, medal hunters can go one step further. Even when a solution is well known, quite a few go the extra mile, or no, extra miles, lightyears even, to try to perfect how to go about hunting for that medal or if the whole solution is really known. The goal as an osu! medal hunter is not just to hunt and obtain as many medals as possible, but in that journey, to deal with nearly every aspect of osu! - its community, all the modes, many of the mods, how something like a star rating rework or a certain map being ranked can change an entire medal and how to adjust. osu! medal hunting is essentially a nexus to all of osu!. Players' niche interests in how to play osu! intercept in one way or another in the osu! medal hunting community. osu! medal hunting doesn't even have to stop what else you do in the game such as grinding ranking and participating in tournaments. As the medals are for you to keep, you can medal hunt whenever you feel like it. *No promises on some medals being consistent in difficulty though.*

Since I first registered in osu!, I immediately liked the medal unlock animation and sound effect that played whenever I somehow unlocked a medal and was already the type to like 100%'ing games as they usually allow me to enjoy the whole experience. I medal hunted here and there, but it truly started when I unlocked "True Torment" entering 2022, and true torment some of those damn medals are. "Not Bluffing" was like the front door to insanity to me, yes, only the front door, and it's very dark inside. I was going to school fearing of coming back home because it meant I had to continue grinding that medal no matter what, and me getting the medal meant I was freed, which was quite the mindset. Guys, please medal hunt with caution. It's awesome to medal hunt with other osu! medal hunters, improve, and brainstorm how to obtain certain medals. But I must admit though, it's not absolute bliss. It can involve certain levels of masochism and sanity questioning as trying to get as many medals as possible means being able to handle nearly anything the game can throw at you, which certainly is very hard to believe, so be happy with just performing your best for fun. Over the past years I've been medal hunting and been in its community, I can tell you the mental is critical and to remember not to hyperfocus so much on just getting medals. You are allowed to look at medals from different angles and talk to others. Perhaps you can improve while having fun and figure new stuff out with medals. You are not a machine, you are probably a human. There's more than just one medal hunter. Work together in figuring out medals, have fun.

I'd also like to give one example of an amazing event that happened in the osu! medal hunting community: "Internment" medal hunt.

The 1 month search of Internment was the best osu! medal hunting event I attended, and it was the grand event of a new medal batch having been released that included 7 other Hush-Hush medals that were either normal or expert. The icon, hint, and subhint were so direct that it always felt like the solution was right there, and even with some of the hints we got that felt so direct yet indirect, some from even peppy himself through a recording, we were still struggling yet had so much hope. It felt like a really awesome mission where everybody was involved in some way and had so much interest, because that whole time, it felt like the solution was right there even though our imaginations could make it seem like it was this extraordinary medal. It felt magical. The thread in Discord for the hunt being complete chaos, all the schizo theories, how there ended up being 1 separate channel from the 1 official thread since some of us got tired of these schizo ideas. Ephemeral really outdid himself with the creation of this medal idea and having it be implemented. This was the perfect sequel to "The Girl in the Forest" medal and its osu! Medal Hunter title. I think the difficulty of finding this medal being just fair enough could not have been nailed any more perfectly. When UberFazz became the first to obtain the medal and also get osu! Medal Hunter title and I saw the solution, I was in awe from how a medal like this could even be made where the hints are actually so good and the medal made so much sense after finding the solution.

If you wish to learn more about what was happening during this event, you can read a [news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-18-the-hunt-for-internment) written about it.

## [Speedrunning](#navigation)

When hearing "osu! speedruns" you may think: How can one even speedrun a game with no definite goal and many new beatmaps coming out daily? Well, you actually can, in multiple ways in fact!

While there is no official and definite end goal, 8 years ago one of the osu! players created an [unofficial leaderboard on speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/osu) for osu!, adding multiple categories to it, including a category that is still a default one to this day, "Full Combo". Like you guessed from the name, this category requires you to FC different amounts of maps (10/25/50/100) as fast as you can, with some additional rules, like all maps having to be ranked/approved or only being allowed to play 1 difficulty per beatmap. Doesn't seem like there's much room for improvement after the shortest maps are found, right? Surprisingly, that's not exactly true!

Yes, current ranking criteria doesn't allow beatmaps shorter than 30 seconds, people found other opportunities to FC the maps faster than others, from literally learning how to switch between maps in the menu faster to finding how to use offset and **cropped MP3's** to their advantage. What do I mean by cropped MP3's? Well, what runners do is they cut the MP3 file right where the final spinner begins, making it end instantly when playing the map, without breaking your combo. So as you can see, there are some unique ways your time can be improved. 

But obviously that's not the only category there is! There are some more ways you could try speedrunning this game, from [FCing all beatmaps in one of the classic beatmap packs](https://www.speedrun.com/osu/levels), to trying to reach certain [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_points) milestones in McOsu (an open source practice client developed by one of the osu! players, [McKay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3321909)) as fast as possible.

Speaking of the latter, pp milestones was also one of the most popular categories on the leaderboard since the moment I created it. It was so popular in fact, that as of recently (01.06.2025) it has its own [McOsu leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/McOsu)! And while 100pp milestone is obviously the most popular one, because of it being the easiest and fastest to do (so fast in fact that the current world record is shorter than 10 seconds), there is another specific milestone I'd like to mention here, 7500pp.

Maybe this category doesn't seem that interesting to get a mention, after all it has way less speedruns submitted, and is second to highest milestone currently, and it was like that until one day a [certain player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10137731) decided to start and fund a speedrunning event on his own. So a bit later [this](https://twitter.com/osuallstars/status/1500116465277493274) Twitter post was created, and we as the leaderboard mods were contacted about the event, so we made a copy of said post on the website itself.

![website announcement screenshot](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-27-unconventional-play-styles/speedrun_event_announcement.png)

And of course such an event was noticed by multiple top players some of you know well, for example [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) and [lifeline](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11367222)! Speaking of lifeline, his strategy closer  to the end of the event is worth mentioning in my opinion. At the moment, mrekk got the fastest run, and it was the fastest for some time, but we didn't know that lifeline already got a faster run, deciding to submit it the very last moments before the event concluded, not giving mrekk any time to get a faster one, and granting lifeline his victory!

So yeah, there actually are multiple ways you could speedrun osu! as you can see, and interesting ones at that. If that sounds interesting to you just it does to me, I recommend you to actually try to speedrun some category from [osu!](https://www.speedrun.com/osu/) or [McOsu](https://www.speedrun.com/McOsu) leaderboard!

We sincerely hope you enjoyed our news post, and while there are more play styles we didn't mention, such as ranked elo lobbies or playing with specific mod combos, we also hope you've found something interesting to try yourself! Thanks for reading <3
